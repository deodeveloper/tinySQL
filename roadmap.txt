Development Roadmap for tinySQL

The major areas for development with tinySQL will be;

1) Performance improvements.  This will involve cutting down the number of 
records scanned by building a Hashtable of simplified keys based upon a 
specific where clause.

2) Addition of more function support, JOIN clause (currently implemented as
part of WHERE clause processing).
